That's an excellent clarification! You've identified the core challenge of Tool Orchestration: handling data dependency and parameter ambiguity across multiple distinct APIs.
The short answer is: Yes, the instructions in the new LangGraph prompt are enough to enable this intelligent data retrieval and chaining, but the success heavily relies on the quality of the tool descriptions and the LLM's inherent reasoning ability.
Here's how this multi-step scenario is handled in the LangGraph orchestration:
1. How LangGraph Handles Data Dependency (The "Why")
The LangGraph architecture is perfectly designed for this "missing parameter" scenario because it operates in a stateful, iterative loop. It doesn't need to know the entire solution upfront; it only needs to decide the next logical step.
Scenario Flow: Column Name \rightarrow Lineage
 * Iteration 1: Planning for Missing Data
   * State: query = "Get lineage for column user_id."
   * Planner Node (LLM Call): The LLM reviews the available tools:
     * Get Lineage (Requires namespace, table, column).
     * Smart Data Retrieval (Takes a column name, returns associated namespace and table).
   * LLM Decision (Output): The LLM realizes it's missing the namespace and table required by the final goal (Get Lineage).
   * LLM Action: call_tool \rightarrow Smart Data Retrieval with parameter {"column": "user_id"}.
   * Router: Routes to the Executor Node.
 * Iteration 2: Executing the Data Retrieval
   * Executor Node: Calls the Smart Data Retrieval API.
   * API Response (Result): {"namespace": "prod_db", "table": "user_profiles"}.
   * State Update: This result is appended to the steps_history.
   * Loop: Router routes back to the Planner Node.
 * Iteration 3: Planning with New Data
   * State: query (same) + steps_history (contains namespace/table from Step 1).
   * Planner Node (LLM Call): The LLM reviews the history and sees the needed parameters are now available.
   * LLM Decision (Output): The LLM constructs the final call.
   * LLM Action: call_tool \rightarrow Get Lineage with parameters: {"namespace": "prod_db", "table": "user_profiles", "column": "user_id"}.
   * Router: Routes to the Executor Node.
 * Iteration 4: Final Execution and Synthesis
   * Executor Node: Calls the Get Lineage API.
   * Loop: Router routes back to the Planner Node.
   * Final Plan: The LLM sees the final lineage data in the history and decides its work is done.
   * LLM Action: respond.
   * Router: Routes to the Synthesizer Node for the final user response.
2. The Role of Tool Description (The "How")
To make the above flow happen, the Tool Descriptions and Schemas are paramount.
A. The Tool Description is the "Instruction Manual"
The LLM is highly dependent on the description to understand the tool's purpose and its requirements.
| Tool | Essential Description Detail |
|---|---|
| Get Lineage | "Retrieves data lineage. REQUIRES the full context: namespace, table, AND column names." |
| Smart Data Retrieval | "Finds the full context (namespace, table) associated with a single piece of user input, like a column name." |
If the Get Lineage description is clear that it must have all three parameters, the LLM's intrinsic reasoning is triggered to find the missing ones first.
B. The Prompt's Power
Crucially, the new prompt structure supports this:
 * {tools_info}: Provides the LLM with the necessary knowledge about the two tools.
 * {history}: Allows the LLM to access the output of the first tool call to correctly format the input for the second tool call (e.g., extracting "prod_db" from the history to place it into the namespace parameter).
Conclusion: You do not need to define this specific Smart Data Retrieval $\rightarrow$ Get Lineage sequence explicitly in the prompt. By providing accurate Tool Descriptions and leveraging the iterative, stateful reasoning of LangGraph, the LLM's general intelligence will deduce the necessary data retrieval step to fulfill the user's ultimate request. The planning becomes dynamic rather than hardcoded.
