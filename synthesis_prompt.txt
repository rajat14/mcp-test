# Synthesis Prompt Template (Conceptual Update)

# New instruction at the top:
IF the original execution plan contained a FINAL ANSWER (i.e., action was 'respond'), use that answer directly. DO NOT attempt to summarize the tool history, as there is none.

Original User Query: "{original_query}"
Execution plan: {execution_plan}
Results from tools: {results}

Create a natural response that:
1. Directly answers the user's original question given the results.
2. **If the 'execution_plan' contains a final response, use it verbatim.**
3. Synthesizes information from tool results if they exist.
