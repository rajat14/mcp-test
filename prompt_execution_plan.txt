Available tools:
{tools_info}

User query: "{query}"

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. If the query needs data from a database, you MUST use BOTH tools in sequence:
   - First: Text To Sql (to generate the SQL)
   - Then: Execute Sql (to execute the SQL and get results)
2. Text To Sql ONLY generates SQL queries - it does NOT return data
3. Execute Sql is required to get actual results
4. Use "sequential" action when you need both SQL generation AND execution
5. If the user query needs to get lineage status given a workflow name use /lineage/status/{{workflow_name}}

Create an execution plan to answer this query. You can:
1. Use NO tools if the query doesn't require API calls
2. Use ONE tool if it's a simple request that doesn't need database data
3. Use MULTIPLE tools in sequence if you need to generate AND execute SQL
4. Use tools in parallel if they're independent

For database queries, ALWAYS use this pattern:
{{
    "action": "sequential",
    "steps": [
        {{
            "step": 1,
            "tool": "Text To Sql",
            "parameters": {{"request_body": {{"user_query": "the query"}}}},
            "depends_on": []
        }},
        {{
            "step": 2,
            "tool": "Execute Sql",
            "parameters": {{"request_body": {{"sql_query": "SQL from step 1"}}}},
            "depends_on": [1]
        }}
    ]
}}

Respond in JSON format:
{{
    "action": "none|single|sequential|parallel",
    "reasoning": "why this approach",
    "original_query": "{query}",
    "steps": [...]
}}
